# crawlspace
a tiny limbo server

for now, this only supports a very tiny subset of the minecraft protocol, and will generally be kept up to date with the latest major changes as it's intended to be behind Velocity with ViaBackwards. it's possible that it'll work on older minecraft versions but honestly I am not intentionally trying to support that

(i don't know rust! this is a work in progress and will be rewritten many times to be More Correct! gimme a sec let me cook!)
